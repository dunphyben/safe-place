# Safe Place Tests

Specs are broken down into categories by Models and Views.

Categories are marked in the js/specs.js file as such:

/////////////////  
//PLACE  
/////////////////  

#### Indicate that you are working on a specific category on the [trello](https://trello.com/b/bU5hOi1d/safe-place) page.
* Move the corresponding card from **To Do - Functionality** to **Doing**.
* Be sure to mark your name!

#### When finished, git pull, resolve conflicts (there shouldn't be any if we're dividing properly) and push the changes to github. 

Move the card to "Done".

Specs are a work in progress, Ben will update them throughout the weekend. Feel free to add more based on how you understand the app to work. BDD FTW.
